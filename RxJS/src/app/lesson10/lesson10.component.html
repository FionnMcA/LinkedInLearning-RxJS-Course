<p>
  Lets say our weather app displays has the ability to display the weather for
  different states, if the user selects a certain state we will display the
  weather for that state. That would mean we have multiple buttons and what if
  the user decides to click them all in a short period of time. this would query
  multiple states at the same time. However they may only be interested in the
  last state they query.<br />
  So for our app we make sure the user only gets data for the last state they
  asked for, even if they clicked multiple states. <br />
  In RxJS we can make sure this happens using <strong>switchMap</strong> the
  RxJs operator that switches to another observable and will cancel pending
  requests to start new ones
