    <div *ngFor="let weather of displayWeather">
      <span>City: {{ weather.city }}</span>

<p>
  If we wanted to make the same weather app to return the weather and humidity,
  we could structure it the same way we did using the switch map. On Click, the
  app would first get the temperature and then the humidity and then present it
  to the client<br />Whats different this time is that the user may want the
  temperature listed for all the queries they made. This means all the get
  weather requests should go through and not be canceled, like we've done
  previously. For this case we will use the RxJS operator
  <strong>mergeMap</strong> This operator still switches between observables but
  wont cancel pending requests
